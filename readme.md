# Boba Drops - Make a Website and Get Boba!

It's easier than ever for high school students to get involved with programming; all you need is a computing device and internet access. Yet, *it's not the same for hardware*.

Every student will receive $5 to cover Boba costs, and join a community of peersâ€“ some more beginner and some more experienced.
## Requirements

Every website/submission needs to meet the following constraints to be approved:

-Unique and open-source design
